* Sanjana Goli
* Meriem Fouad
* Abubakar Kasule
* Rohith Mandavilli
* Katrina Yu
 
 
## I. Identify a Common Vision
*You’ve all voted on a common idea and themes. Now is the time to work through your commonalities and find a unifying vision between all of you. Answer the following for each of you.  This is the time to speak your mind.  Be honest with each other.*
 
### Commonalities
*Who makes up your team?  What are some common things you are interested in? Tell each other about the things you put down on the survey and expand on some of your passions.*
Basketball, Coding, Care about the news, Care about Africa, Minimalistic UI
 
### Inspiration
*What are some things each of you is inspired by?*
Correct information!
Tim Tregubov <3
The Early warning Project’s vision
Big Data
Making products for consumers
 
### Problems of Interest
*What problems are you looking to address? Why?*
Asymmetric access to information
Governmental Accountability
Lack of prior warning for conflicts
Shady news outlets that are trusted
Fake News
### Identify
*Which of the above is most interesting to all of you?*
Fake News
 
## II. Narrow In
*Now let's try narrowing in on a problem that interests all of you. Make sure to go around and listen to everybody on your team without interruption.*
 
### Problem Statement
*State the problem you want to solve succinctly.*
There is no reliable universal source of news on Africa
 
### Rephrase
*Try to rephrase the problem statement (negative) as an opportunity (positive). Word it as a question beginning with, “How might we…?”*
How might we create a platform to make African news more accessible and reliable?
 
### Reframe
*Reframe the question in at least 5 different ways to change the question fundamentally or imply a different solution set.  Try changing scope, or audience, or technology.*
 
1. How might we determine which news sources are accurate?
2. How might we distribute news to those who need it?
3. How might we make it easier to access verifiable news on Africa?
4. How might we make it more difficult for fake news creators to disseminate their articles?
5. How might we generate reliable news with the readers’ input?
 
### Choose
*Are any of the reframes more interesting?  Choose one.*
How might we make it easier to access verifiable news on Africa?
#### Coolness
*What could be cool about this potential project?*
Scales up very well - this app is applicable to any geographic area which does not have access to reliable news
It could be a game-changing tool for conflict prevention as well as a provider of a more balanced view of Africa today.
 
#### Challenges
*What could be challenging / unfun about this potential project?*
Language
Determining how to rank credibility of news sources
Hard to motivate individuals to contribute to the app without the guarantee of getting anything out of it
Because it’s a two part app (getting news sources and getting news from the people) this might be a bit awkward to combine
Parsing user input => think about how answers affect weights for news sources (maybe develop some ML algo)
#### Success
*What does success look like for this project?*
The app is functional for anyone who wants to see information
The app displays information based on user input
Customizable categories of news based on the user
Incorporates a way to rank credibility/preferences of news sources
## III. Survey the State of the Art
*Do some research. Try to find what else is out there that is similar, either products, or technical papers that are related.*
Africanews on mobile phones and tablets - Only shows content from their own platform
Google News and Flipboard are also serving the African news market
A lot of people also listen to their radios to get news
### Similar Goals
*Are there others working to achieve similar goals?*
Africanews, Early Warning Project, Apple News, Google News, Facebook
### Differences
*How is your approach different/better than the state of the art?*
Two ideas combined in one: not just giving people news but also getting information from them
 
### Inspiration
*Are there any existing products/techniques/research, that we could, by analogy, draw inspiration from?*

## IV. Team Dynamics
*And finally, let's think through a couple of team dynamics things as we'll be working together for the next month.*
 
 
### Schedule
 
*Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. That one meeting must include everyone on the team. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).*
 
* Zoom link - time of day.
 
### Responsiveness
*How often should team members be expected to check and respond on Slack?*
 
Often
 
### Rules
MVP over everytttthting
Master branch better work
No duplicate code
Screenshots when merging to master if relevant
Work in sprints 
Proper use of git/zenhub
Use slack and push frequently
Be honest if things aren’t working
 
### Group Decisions
*What types of decisions need to be discussed and approved by the entire group?*
 
Features of the App
Big changes in technology or dependencies
Big changes in the organization of the app
Anything that will affect other people’s work 
Merging to master will be a 2 person decision
Planning the MVP 
MASTER SHOULD ALWAYS RUN
 
### Individual Decisions
*What types of decisions can be made by a single person?*

How things are coded is up to the coder
Small UI changes are fine as long as it doesn’t deviate too much
How to unit test 
 
### Conflict Resolution
*There are three main types of conflict that tend to occur in group projects*
 
* *Creative differences: disagreement on any decisions related to the product*
* *Personal differences: friction between people due to manner or words said*
* *Ghosting: consistent missed deadlines or lack of contribution*
 
*Your group should decide on a plan of action to deal with each type of conflict. There can be multiple levels to each plan. Involving the TA's or instructor can be part of it. Try to be specific*
 
* Creative Differences: 
1. See who is affected the most/ the most aware of the topic we are discussing 
2. Take a vote if the first two fail

* Personal Differences:
1. Open honest conversation 
2. If legal, get drunk and makeup

* Ghosting: 
1. We are doing pair programming so the second member of the pair should talk to them
2. Be understanding and redistribute work
3. Public shaming if a and b fail
